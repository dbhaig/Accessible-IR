IR Receiver functionality

Program mode using python program:
- asks user to press a particular button
- accepts value once it has been successfully received 3 times consecutively
- asks user if they want to save the value in EEPROM

= RCA remote control =
RCA remote control signals are not recognized by IRLIB2 library.
- IR Scrutinizer decodes the protocol as: protocol = RCA-38, device = 15, obc = 47

(2014-05-04)   Thomson / RCA Protocol
56 kHz modulation.  Pulse-distance encoding.

    Each burst has a fixed width of 0.5 ms  (28 cycles).  A logical "0" is a burst followed by  1 ms  (56 cycles)  of silence  (for a total duration of 1.5 ms).  A logical "1" is a burst followed by a space of 2 ms  (2.5 ms total duration).

    A frame starts with a 4 ms burst (224 cycles) followed by a 4 ms space.  The 12-bit data is then sent most significant bits first,  first a 4-bit address then an 8-bit command.  The complements of those 12-bits are then sent in the same order to validate the data.  The total duration to this point is always  56 ms.  An 8 ms stop space brings the duration of a frame to 64 ms.

    The same frame is sent repeatedly as long as the key is pressed.  (No toggle bit?!)
